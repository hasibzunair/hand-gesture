# hand-gesture-recognition

Here I have demonstrated a hand gesture recognition system using color segementation and image filtering techniques. After detection it prints out the number of fingers being shown.

# Dependencies 

I have used the following dependencies.

   * opencv
   * numpy
   * math

   
# Results

Below are the results which show the number of fingers that are being detected. On the right side, the mask is also displayed.
