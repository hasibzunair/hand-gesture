# hand-gesture-recognition

Here I have demonstrated a hand gesture recognition system using color segementation and image filtering techniques. After detection it prints out the number of fingers being shown.

# Dependencies 

I have used the following dependencies.

   * opencv
   * numpy
   * math

   
# Results

Below is the result for the processes that occurs in the back end of the script for detection. A mask is created and then it is being further processed to reduce noise. The output is shown in the screen. <br />
